##### - First of all you need bot Token that you can get from @BotFather in Telegram apps. ```Nb find the one with bluecheck âœ…```
##### - Next Incase You Need It
        
```/start```  **for starting your journey do this greeting to father and then;**

```/newbot```
    **father will ask several questions  to you, just respond to each question as a normal people did read it carefully and follow if he give you an instruction**

**I think its only two steps, there will be a long text from father and you must find after *HTTP API: ```54321312:som3text_youshould_save``` copy it somewhere save, i mean it!, cause that's what we need, a ```TOKEN```**
